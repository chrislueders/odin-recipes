    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Aglio e Olio is a traditional Italian pasta dish that is simple yet flavorful. To make this dish, start by boiling a pot of salted water and cooking spaghetti until al dente. While the pasta cooks, heat olive oil in a pan over medium heat and add sliced garlic. Cook the garlic until it becomes fragrant and lightly golden, being careful not to burn it. Then, add red pepper flakes and cook for another minute.</p>
    <p>Once the spaghetti is cooked, reserve a cup of pasta water and drain the rest. Add the spaghetti to the pan with the garlic and oil, along with a splash of the reserved pasta water. Toss everything together until the spaghetti is coated in the garlic and oil mixture. Serve hot, topped with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired. Aglio e Olio is a quick and easy pasta dish that can be made with just a few simple ingredients, making it perfect for a weeknight dinner or a last-minute meal.</p>
