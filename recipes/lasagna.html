    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, cheese, meat sauce, and sometimes vegetables. To make lasagna, you will need lasagna noodles, ground beef or sausage, tomato sauce, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, and seasonings like garlic, salt, and pepper.</p>
    <p>To start, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions and set them aside. Brown the ground beef or sausage in a pan and add tomato sauce and seasonings. In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, and more seasonings. Now it's time to assemble the lasagna. Spread a layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles, a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture, and a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers until you have used up all of your ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top. Bake in the oven at 375°F for about 30-40 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</p>
